## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Direct File Inputs Pass Through

The system SHALL accept individual file paths (not just directories) as inputs. If a file has a recognised archive extension (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`) and archive extraction is enabled, the system SHALL extract the archive to a temporary directory and include the extracted files in the result instead of the archive path itself. For non-archive files, the system SHALL return them unchanged when they match the configured extension filter.

#### Scenario: Single-file input
- **GIVEN** the user runs `subx convert movie.srt`
- **WHEN** `collect_files` runs
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain exactly `movie.srt`

#### Scenario: Archive file input is extracted
- **GIVEN** the user runs `subx convert subs.zip` and the zip contains
  `movie.srt` and `movie2.ass`
- **WHEN** `collect_files` runs
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain the extracted `movie.srt` and
  `movie2.ass` from the temp directory, and SHALL NOT contain `subs.zip`

#### Scenario: 7z archive file input is extracted
- **GIVEN** the user runs `subx convert subs.7z` and the 7z contains
  `movie.srt`
- **WHEN** `collect_files` runs
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain the extracted `movie.srt` from
  the temp directory, and SHALL NOT contain `subs.7z`

#### Scenario: Tar.gz archive file input is extracted
- **GIVEN** the user runs `subx convert subs.tar.gz` and the archive
  contains `movie.srt`
- **WHEN** `collect_files` runs
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain the extracted `movie.srt` from
  the temp directory, and SHALL NOT contain `subs.tar.gz`

#### Scenario: Archive file with --no-extract is skipped
- **GIVEN** the user runs `subx convert subs.zip --no-extract`
- **WHEN** `collect_files` runs
- **THEN** `subs.zip` SHALL be treated as a regular file, SHALL fail
  the extension filter (`.zip` is not a subtitle extension), and SHALL
  NOT appear in the result

### Requirement: Mixed File And Directory Inputs

The system SHALL accept a mixture of file, directory, and archive entries within the same input list; on `collect_files()` it SHALL return the matched files from every supplied directory (filtered by the configured extensions and traversal mode), the extracted contents of every recognised archive (when extraction is enabled), and every directly supplied file that matches the extension filter. Exercised by `tests/match_combined_paths_tests.rs::test_match_command_with_individual_files_and_directories` and `tests/unified_path_handling_tests.rs::test_input_path_handler_merge`.

#### Scenario: Files from directories plus individual file paths
- **GIVEN** two directories `dir1/` (containing `video1.mp4`, `subtitle1.srt`) and `dir2/` (containing `video2.mkv`, `subtitle2.srt`), and an input list of `[video1.mp4, dir2, subtitle1.srt]`
- **WHEN** `get_input_handler().collect_files()` runs non-recursively with the video+subtitle extension filter
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain all four files: `video1.mp4`, `subtitle1.srt`, `video2.mkv`, and `subtitle2.srt`

#### Scenario: Files, directories, and archives mixed
- **GIVEN** inputs `[video1.mp4, dir2/, subs.7z]` where `dir2/` contains
  `video2.mkv` and `subtitle2.srt`, and `subs.7z` contains `extra.srt`
- **WHEN** `collect_files()` runs with video+subtitle extension filter
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain `video1.mp4`, `video2.mkv`,
  `subtitle2.srt`, and `extra.srt`
