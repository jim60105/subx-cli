Development progress for this project is systematically tracked within the `.github/codex` directory. Treat all past reports as immutable referencesâ€”do not edit or revise them under any circumstance. Upon the completion of each task, you are required to generate a new comprehensive work report. Refer to the naming conventions of existing files to determine an appropriate filename. 

Your report must include a detailed account of the work performed, encompassing all relevant code modifications and corresponding test outcomes.

Write a report following #file:./.github/codex/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md and #file:./.github/codex/README.md in Chinese.
