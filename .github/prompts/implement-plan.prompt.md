# Work Report Protocol

Development progress for this project is systematically tracked within the `.github/reports` directory. Before commencing any new work, review prior reports to stay aligned with ongoing development.

Refer to the naming conventions of existing files to determine an appropriate filename. 

Your report must include a detailed account of the work performed, encompassing all relevant code modifications and corresponding test outcomes.
