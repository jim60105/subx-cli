**We are at planning stage so don't start to implement anything!**

> This time, the work requires greater accuracy. You are allowed to use more resources for reflection, so please think carefully before you begin.

Please do a deep research and write the development plan under `.github/plans` folder in 正體中文. The plan should be very detailed (try your best!) because I will assign these tasks to newbies in the future. Please write documentation that enables anyone to complete the work successfully. However, do not mention 'newbies' in the document, as I do not want to undermine the employee's confidence.
