**We are at planning stage so don't start to implement anything!**

> This time, the work requires greater accuracy. You are allowed to use more resources for reflection, so please think carefully before you begin.

Please conduct a deep research in #codebase and write the development plan in the `.github/plans/backlogs` or `.github/plans/bugs` folder. Write the plans themselves in 正體中文, but use English for example code comments and CLI responses following #file:./docs/rustdoc-guidelines.md. The plan should be very detailed (try your best!) because I will assign these tasks to newbies in the future. Please write documentation that enables anyone to complete the work successfully. However, do not mention 'newbies' in the document, as I do not want to undermine the employee's confidence.

Get the latest number from the (backlogs or bugs) folder.

Lets's do this step by step.
