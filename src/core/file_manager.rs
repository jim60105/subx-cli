//! Safe file operation management with atomic rollback capabilities.
//!
//! This module provides the [`FileManager`] for performing batch file operations
//! with full rollback support. It's designed to ensure that complex file
//! operations either complete entirely or leave the filesystem unchanged.
//!
//! # Key Features
//!
//! - **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing batch file operations
//! - **Automatic Backup**: Removed files are backed up for restoration
//! - **Operation Tracking**: Complete history of all performed operations
//! - **Safe Rollback**: Guaranteed restoration to original state on failure
//! - **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of filesystem errors during rollback
//!
//! # Use Cases
//!
//! ## Batch Subtitle Processing
//! When processing multiple subtitle files, ensure that either all files
//! are successfully processed or none are modified:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::path::Path;
//! # use subx_cli::core::file_manager::FileManager;
//! let mut manager = FileManager::new();
//!
//! // Process multiple files
//! // ... processing logic ...
//!
//! // If something goes wrong, rollback
//! manager.rollback()?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! ## Safe File Replacement
//! Replace files with new versions while maintaining rollback capability:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::path::Path;
//! # use subx_cli::core::file_manager::FileManager;
//! let mut manager = FileManager::new();
//!
//! // Remove old file (automatically backed up)
//! manager.remove_file(Path::new("old_file.srt"))?;
//! // Create new file (tracked for rollback)
//! manager.record_creation(Path::new("new_file.srt"));
//!
//! // If something goes wrong later...
//! manager.rollback()?; // old_file.srt is restored, new_file.srt is removed
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety Guarantees
//!
//! The [`FileManager`] provides strong safety guarantees:
//!
//! 1. **No Data Loss**: Removed files are always backed up before deletion
//! 2. **Consistent State**: Rollback always returns to the exact original state
//! 3. **Error Isolation**: Filesystem errors during rollback don't corrupt state
//! 4. **Resource Cleanup**: Temporary files and backups are properly managed

/// Safe file operation manager with rollback capabilities.
///
/// The `FileManager` provides atomic file operations with automatic
/// rollback functionality. It tracks all file creations and deletions,
/// allowing complete operation reversal in case of errors.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Batch file operations that need to be atomic
/// - Temporary file creation during processing
/// - Safe file replacement with backup
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use subx_cli::core::file_manager::FileManager;
/// use std::path::Path;
///
/// let mut manager = FileManager::new();
/// // Create a new file (tracked for rollback)
/// manager.record_creation(Path::new("output.srt"));
/// // Remove an existing file (backed up for rollback)
/// manager.remove_file(Path::new("old_file.srt")).unwrap();
/// // If something goes wrong, rollback all operations
/// manager.rollback().unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The manager ensures that:
/// - Created files are properly removed on rollback
/// - Removed files are backed up and restored on rollback
/// - No partial state is left after rollback completion
