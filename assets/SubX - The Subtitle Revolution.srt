00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:12,093
Files scattered everywhere

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,469
no rhyme or reason

3
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,950
video here, subtitles there

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,173
it's chaos season

5
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,046
But there's a tool

6
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:24,029
that's going to change the game

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,000
SubX is here

8
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:29,080
it knows each file by name

00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,679
AI scanning through the mess, 

10
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:34,079

11
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,616
finding pairs in the digital maze

12
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,836
organizing all your days

13
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,064
SubX, SubX

14
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:43,615
making sense of all the noise

15
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:46,522
auto-matching batch processing

16
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:48,592
it's your choice

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,600
from SRT to ASS, VTT to SUB

18
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:55,115
converting formats

19
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:56,899
that's the rub

20
00:00:58,616 --> 00:00:59,954
SubX, SubX

21
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,735

00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,805
Dry-run mode to show you

25
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:13,953
what it'll do

26
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,689
Preview first, then execute when you're through

27
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,055
Cache remembers what it learned before

28
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,256
Efficiency knocking at your door

29
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,679
Folders full of media files

30

Process them for miles and miles

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,418
Copy, move, rename with grace

32
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:37,754

Auto-matching, batch processing 

36
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,879
is your choice, 

37
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,859
from SRT to ASS, VTT to SUB

38
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,535
converting formats

39
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,411
that's the rub

40
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,528
SubX, SubX,

41
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:02,168
